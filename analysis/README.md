## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you throught the utilization of the scripts we developed related to the main project, [BELLA](https://github.com/giuliaguidi/bella).

## Overlapping Feasibility via Markov Chain Model

In the paper, we present a theory on how k-mers (subsequences) can be used to anchor alignments between two long reads, allowing an accurate overlap discovery among all the reads in a dataset.  
To run the script implementing the Markov Chain Model we developed to show the overlapping feasibility, do:
```
python exactMarkov.py
```
The default function setting is:
```python
func(overlap=500, p=0.85, k=17)
```

The program with default setting computes the probability to get 17 consecutive successes on both the sequences given an overlap length of 500bp and a sequencing success probability equal to 0.85.

## Scripts for Consolidating dAligner Alignment Results in BELLA Format

```
Run translateDalignerOut.sh with a script specifiying the desired local alignments (.las file) and corresponding (DAZZ_DB) database instance,
along with the necessary executables. (The full detailed requirements list is specified in translateDalignerOut.sh).
An example setup script (for NERSC's Cori) is example-environment-script.sh.   
```
